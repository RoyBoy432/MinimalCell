Science in press. 2010) An A to G mutation was present in some molecules of the chemically synthesized cassette mmyc122. This mutation was incorporated into the assembled genome%2C resulting in a new HaeIII site. This mutation changed the original mmyc122 cassette sequence from AAATATGACTATAATTTAACAGATGGACC to AAATATGACTATAATTTAACAGATGGGCC in the final molecule. These substrings of the mmyc122 cassette sequence uniquely identify the HaeIII site within the final molecule.
