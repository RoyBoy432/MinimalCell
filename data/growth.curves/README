We used traditional microplate growth curves, measuring Absorbance at 600 nm every 15 minutes for >=24 hr to attaempt to infer growth parameters such as max growth rate, lag time, and population density. This was not wlays feasible with the ancestor strains because they did not reliably generate measurable turbidity. The evolved strains did generate measurable turbidity.
