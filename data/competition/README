Each folder contains raw flow cytometry data from the named experiment date, along with summary human-readable files showing the plotted data and gating information. These data were inputted into the SP4_competitions.xlsx file to compute values for relative fitness based on the data outcomes for each competition experiment. SOI = Strain Of Interest. mCherry = mCherry-expressing JCVI-syn1.0 strain. W_W column computes the value for relative fitness as described in the Methods. The "Delaney" and "r_W" columns compute a different measure that could be used to express fitness but was not used here.
