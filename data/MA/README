The *summary.tools.xlsx files contain the full compiled data of all of the mutations that occurred across all of the lines, one spreadsheet for each genotype.

Each of the other files are subsets of these data. (In the case of MA_summary_for_R.csv, it is a pooled set of both datasheets.) The subsetting has a specific goal indicated in the filename. For example for the MA_grouped_bar_SNM.xlsx file, the data were reformatted to facilitate generated a grouped bar plot of the 6 different types of SNMs.

Files with *DEPRECATED* in the filename indicates that the data are outdated.

REMOVED* file is a notetaking file where I assessed which of the original lines contained unreliable data.
