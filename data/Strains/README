*DNDS* files: Tabulation of the frequencies of called synonnyous and nonsynonymous mutations across replicate NSE populations

20190903* : meeting notes

breseq_outputs* : these files contain the human-readable outputs from breseq. I also subsequently removed different categories of called mutations that were not of interest for specific downstream analyses. The types of mutations removed are indicated in the filenames, and the files were separated into separate ones for wildtype and for minimal.

GxP.txt: testfile representation of the gene-by-population matrix

GxP_Mm_all.shared* : these files are the gene-by-population matrices focusing on the genes that are possessed by both strains so as to make a fair comparison.

mutation.frequencies* : these files were used as inputs for the simulations

pvals_simulations_TOOLS.xlsx: Excel file for investigating the output of the simulations---specifically the p values.

shared.genes.xlsx : breseq outputs subsetted such that it includes all the genes which were mutated across >1 replicate line for each strain

some.genes.pdf : notes

strains.construct.request* : choosing specific mutations to possibly investigate further using molecular genetics
